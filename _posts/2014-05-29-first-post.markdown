I've been using Wordpress for over 10 years. It's become and amazing platform for blogging thanks to
an amazingly vibrant community and the numerous innovations from [automattic]. I still 
use it for more media rich blogging but for code and tech, it's hard to beat http://pages.github.com. 
Combining that with [jekyll] and you get a fantastically simple platform for creating technical content
with features like:

* Versioning of content using git
* Blog content written in markdown
* Simple, vim friendly content structure
* Fantastic code syntax highlighting

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
# This highlighting rocks!
{% endhighlight %}

I look forward to many more posts to come on this new platform!
